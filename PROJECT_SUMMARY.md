## Key Technologies Used

| Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Next.js 16** | Full-stack framework with App Router |
| **React 19.2** | UI component library |
| **Supabase** | PostgreSQL database + Auth |
| **Tailwind CSS v4** | Styling with utility classes |
| **shadcn/ui** | Pre-built component library |
| **TypeScript** | Type safety |
| **RLS Policies** | Row-level database security |

## Database Schema (9 Main Tables)

1. **users** - Student/instructor profiles
2. **courses** - Course definitions with instructor
3. **enrollments** - Student enrollment with 12-week timer
4. **modules** - Weekly course structure (Week 1-12)
5. **lessons** - Lectures with content
6. **labs** - Hands-on assignments
7. **quizzes** - Self-assessment questions
8. **exams** - 4 major assessments
9. **submissions** - All student work (labs, quizzes, exams)
10. **violations** - Academic integrity tracking
11. **grades_summary** - Aggregated student performance
12. **certificates** - Completion certificates

## Grading Formula

\`\`\`
Final Score = (Lab Avg × 0.40) + (Quiz Avg × 0.30) + (Exam Avg × 0.30)

Where:
- Lab Avg = Average of all lab submission scores
- Quiz Avg = Average of all quiz scores
- Exam Avg = Average of 4 exam scores
- Passing = ≥ 70%
\`\`\`

## Plagiarism Detection Algorithm

1. **Normalize** - Remove comments, whitespace, standardize formatting
2. **Extract** - Parse code into blocks (functions, classes)
3. **Compare** - Calculate Levenshtein distance between blocks
4. **Score** - Generate similarity percentage (0-100%)
5. **Flag** - Mark as suspicious if >70% similar
6. **Record** - Store violation record for tracking

## Workflow Examples

### Student Complete's Course in 12 Weeks

\`\`\`
Week 1:  Enroll → Timer starts (12 weeks) → Complete lectures/labs/quiz
Week 2:  Continue learning → Submit more labs → Take quizzes
Week 3:  Same pattern
Week 4:  EXAM 1 (timed, 60 min) → Grade shows immediately
Week 5-7: More content & assessments
Week 8:  EXAM 2 → Grades update
Week 9-11: Continued work
Week 12: EXAM 4 → Final exams & assessments

End of Week 12:
- Final score calculated: (Lab Avg × 0.40) + (Quiz × 0.30) + (Exams × 0.30)
- If score ≥ 70% AND no 3+ violations:
  ✓ Certificate auto-generated
  ✓ Student can download certified document
  ✓ Certificate number in system for verification
\`\`\`

### Instructor Manages Course

\`\`\`
1. Create course (12 weeks, title, description)
2. For each week:
   - Add 2-3 lectures with content
   - Add 1-2 labs with submission requirements
   - Add 1 quiz for self-assessment
3. Add 4 exams (scheduled for weeks 4, 8, 10, 12)
4. For each exam:
   - Create 10-20 questions
   - Mark correct answers
   - Set point values
5. Monitor student progress in real-time
6. Review submissions and plagiarism flags
7. Manage violations & strikes
8. Issue certificates upon completion

## Technical Notes

### Security Considerations
- All queries use parameterized statements (no SQL injection)
- RLS policies enforce student data isolation
- Service role key stored securely in Vercel
- No sensitive data in client-side code
- HTTPS enforced for all connections

### Performance Optimizations
- Database indexes on all foreign keys
- Query optimization with proper selects
- Client-side caching with SWR
- CSS-in-JS with Tailwind for minimal bundle
- Image optimization for course materials

### Scalability Path
1. **0-100 users**: Current setup sufficient
2. **100-500 users**: Enable Supabase Pro ($25/mo)
3. **500-1000 users**: Add database replicas
4. **1000+ users**: Implement caching layer (Redis)

## Conclusion

This platform provides a **production-ready bootcamp system** that instructors can immediately use to deliver professional software development courses. The combination of comprehensive assessment tools, plagiarism detection, and automatic grading makes it suitable for serious educational programs.

The modular architecture allows easy expansion with additional features while maintaining security and performance. All code follows Next.js 16 best practices and is optimized for the edge with Vercel deployment.
